    <h3 class="headers">Description</h3>
    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! </p>
    <h3 class="headers">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie </li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>¼ cup water </li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar </li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="headers">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
    </ol>
